[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/new/template/o3MbZe)


## ✨ Features

- NGINX
- Static Site

## 💁‍♀️ How to use

- Open the `site/index.html` in the browser

## 📝 Notes

By default the `site/` directory gets deployed as a static site. This can be modified by changing the `Dockerfile`.

The site is deployed using the default NGINX configuration. This can be overridden with a custom conf file by adding

```
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
COPY conf.d/* /etc/nginx/conf.d/
COPY stream.d/* /etc/nginx/stream.d/
```

to the end of the Dockerfile. For more information, [read the docs](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx).
